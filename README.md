# testing-workshop chapter3 [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/the-james-burton/testing-workshop.svg?branch=chapter3)](https://travis-ci.org/the-james-burton/testing-workshop)

*DRAFT*

## The Situation

You should now have a working CI build that shows coverage on your method. However, you will see that there is some untested code. We need to get this code tested.

## Your Mission

To proceed, we need to improve the code to allow us to pass in a file as an argument. We can then test with several different files and increase the test coverage. Go ahead and make the changes.
